###### Before diving into the setup, it's important to understand some core concepts as mentioned below :-
######## Topics: Kafka organizes data into topics, which are logical channels for data streams.
######## Producers: Producers are responsible for publishing data to Kafka topics.
######## Brokers: Kafka brokers are the servers that store and manage the data.
######## Consumers: Consumers read and process data from Kafka topics.
######## Partitions: Kafka topics can be divided into partitions, which enable parallelism and distribution of data.
